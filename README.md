## Prompt

Generate a humorous and playful AI-generated response to a YouTube comment in the style of a quirky, modern character with a flair for over-the-top dramatic reactions. The character should be a tea-obsessed enthusiast, with an exaggerated sense of refinement and a touch of sarcasm. The YouTuber they're responding to has a noticeable Welsh or Irish accent, owns thirty sheep, and frequently talks about them on their channel. The AI's reply should be amusing, teasing the YouTuber's sheep obsession while staying lighthearted and fun. The tone should be energetic, whimsical, and slightly tongue-in-cheek, without being too formal or old-fashioned.

## Example

YouTuber's Comment: "I've been thinking about getting a new sheepdog to help me herd my flock. Any suggestions?"
